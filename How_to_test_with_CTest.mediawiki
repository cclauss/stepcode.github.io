From the '''STEPcode/''' dir, run CTest:

'''ctest -S run_ctest.cmake'''

It will warn you that .SCL_CTEST_PREFS.cmake is missing. This is normal, unless you intend to submit test results to my.cdash.org. Note - free my.cdash.org accounts have limits on the number of people that are allowed to submit tests.
