== Without ctest script ==
'''Preferred method'''
* configure with SC_ENABLE_TESTING=ON, i.e.
<code lang='bash'>cmake .. -DSC_ENABLE_TESTING=ON</code>
* build:
<code lang='bash'>make</code>
* run tests:
<code lang='bash'>make test</code>
* results will look like
<code>  Running tests...

== Via ctest script ==
'''Note:''' this is not recommended, as results are not reported unless result submission is enabled and you look at [http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=StepClassLibrary my.cdash.org] after running the tests.
From the '''STEPcode/''' dir, run CTest:
<code lang='bash'>ctest -S run_ctest.cmake</code>

It will warn you that .SC_CTEST_PREFS.cmake is missing. This is normal, unless you are set up to submit test results to my.cdash.org. Free my.cdash.org accounts have limits on the number of people that are allowed to submit tests, so please discuss on the mailing list before you create the file.
