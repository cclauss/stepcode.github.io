== Without ctest script ==
'''Preferred method'''
* configure with SCL_ENABLE_TESTING=ON, i.e.
    cmake .. -DSCL_ENABLE_TESTING=ON
* build:
    make
* run tests:
    make test
* results will look like
  Running tests...
  Test project /opt/step/test-scl/build_ctest
          Start   1: generate_cpp_ap239_arm_lf
    1/137 Test   #1: generate_cpp_ap239_arm_lf ........................................   Passed    3.55 sec
          Start   2: build_cpp_sdai_ap239_arm_lf
    2/137 Test   #2: build_cpp_sdai_ap239_arm_lf ......................................   Passed   84.97 sec
and so on.
== Via ctest script ==
'''Note:''' this is not recommended, as results are not reported unless result submission is enabled and you look at [http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=StepClassLibrary my.cdash.org] after running the tests.
From the '''STEPcode/''' dir, run CTest:
    ctest -S run_ctest.cmake

It will warn you that .SCL_CTEST_PREFS.cmake is missing. This is normal, unless you are set up to submit test results to my.cdash.org. Free my.cdash.org accounts have limits on the number of people that are allowed to submit tests, so please discuss on the mailing list before you create the file.
