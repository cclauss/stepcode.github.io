C++ examples
------------

-   [Minimal Part 21 C++
    example](Minimal Part 21 C++ example "wikilink")
-   doxygen documentation of [apps using
    STEPcode](http://stepcode.org/stepcode-use-doxygen/)
-   [sc/test/cpp/](http://github.com/stepcode/stepcode/tree/master/test/cpp/)
    - tests written in c++; these can be built when ENABLE\_TESTING is
    set to ON, but are excluded from 'make all'
-   [sc/src/test](http://github.com/stepcode/stepcode/tree/master/src/test)
    - tests written by NIST; not guaranteed to be up-to-date except for
    [p21read](https://github.com/stepcode/stepcode/blob/master/src/test/p21read/p21read.cc#L138)
-   [sc/src/clprobe-ui](http://github.com/stepcode/stepcode/tree/master/src/clprobe-ui)
    - remnants of a UI known as dataProbe; requires the
    [InterViews](http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/interviews.html)
    toolkit, which predates X windows. An attempt has been made to
    resurrect it, but without success.
