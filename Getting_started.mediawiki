== Download STEPcode ==
=== Install git ===
Windows users: use [http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ msysgit], which also includes working versions of bison and flex. The app referenced in GitHub Bootcamp (link below) may work as well, but it does not include bison and flex.

For OSX, see [https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git GitHub Bootcamp]

For Linux, install git through your package manager.

Alternately (not recommended): download an archive of the current code with '''no''' revision history by clicking [https://github.com/stepcode/stepcode/zipball/master here].
=== Install CMake ===
Linux users, install cmake via your package manager. For OSX and Windows, download from [http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html cmake.org]

=== Install Flex and Bison ===
Windows: If you did not install msysgit above, you will need [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm bison] and [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/flex.htm flex]. '''Not all versions work.'''
OSX and Linux: Flex and Bison were probably installed with your compiler.
=== Clone the repository ===
From the command prompt:
 git clone git://github.com/stepcode/stepcode.git
Git will create a directory ''stepcode'' and clone the repository there. Once done, the latest revision will be checked out. You will be able to view revision logs, switch branches, etc - see [http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics Git Basics]
== Build STEPcode ==
See '''[[Building STEPcode]]'''. STEPcode uses CMake, which is cross-platform and somewhat different from the traditional unix './configure && make'
