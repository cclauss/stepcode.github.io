== Download STEPcode ==
=== Install git ===
Windows users: [http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ msysgit] is known to work. The app referenced in GitHub Bootcamp (link below) should work as well.

For OSX, see [https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git GitHub Bootcamp]

For Linux, install git through your package manager.

Alternately (not recommended): download an archive of the latest code with '''no''' revision history by clicking [https://github.com/stepcode/stepcode/zipball/master here].
=== Install CMake ===
Linux users, install cmake via your package manager. For OSX and Windows, download from [http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html cmake.org]

=== Install Flex and Bison ===
v0.7 and later '''do not use''' flex or bison.
=== Clone the repository ===
From the command prompt:
 git clone git://github.com/stepcode/stepcode.git
Git will create a directory ''stepcode'' and clone the repository there. Once done, the latest revision will be checked out. You will be able to view revision logs, switch branches, etc - see [http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics Git Basics]
== Build STEPcode ==
See '''[[Building STEPcode]]'''. STEPcode uses CMake, which is cross-platform and somewhat different from the traditional unix './configure && make'
