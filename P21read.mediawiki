'''p21read''' refers to one of many executables built from STEPcode. Each p21read executable is specific to one EXPRESS schema.

This executable is useful for testing STEPcode; it reads a Part 21 file into memory and writes it to a new file. Any errors indicate problems, but not the source. 

Errors could be from one of three sources:
* STEPcode itself
* the Part 21 file
* the EXPRESS schema
