== Required packages ==
* cmake >= v2.8.3
* bison
* flex

For windows, the versions of flex and bison that are distributed in [http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ msysgit] are known to work. Some flex versions newer than v2.5.35 do not work on windows.

== How to build ==

<code language="shell">cd scl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..    # '..' is the path to the directory containing the top-level CMakeLists.txt
make</code>

== Configuration options (append to the 'cmake ..' line): ==
* -DBUILD_SCHEMAS="''path/to/schema.exp'';''path/to/schema2.exp''"
** For each schema listed, this
*** generates c++
*** compiles it into a library
*** builds a 'p21read' program (see below)
** Will also work with directories, as long as each directory has a single express file. Multiple files/directories are separated by semicolons.
* -DSCL_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel]
** default is a Debug build
** Release turns on optimizations and strips out debugging information
** see also: cmake documentation for CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

== Create c++ for a schema manually: ==
<pre>
mkdir schema_name
cd schema_name
path/to/fedex_plus path/to/schema.exp
</pre>

== Files created in build dir ==
* build/src/ contains source generated by ''flex'' and ''bison''
* build/CMakeFiles contains temporary files (i.e. .o files)
* build/SCHEMA_NAME contains source generated for schema ''SCHEMA_NAME''
** note that SCHEMA_NAME is the name of the express file, without the .exp extension
* build/bin/ contains executables
** ''fedex_plus''
*** Generates C++ code
** ''fedex_python''
*** Generates Python code
** ''exppp''
*** Express Pretty Printer
*** Normally, this isn't built
** ''check_express''
*** Formerly ''fedex''
*** Parses the express and checks for errors. The functionality of fedex_plus/fedex_python is a superset of this.
** ''p21read_sdai_SCHEMA_NAME''
*** reads one step file and writes another. It may change whitespace or remove comments; otherwise, the input and output files are supposed to be identical. If they are not identical, either the file does not match the schema, or there is a bug in SCL.
* build/lib/ contains libraries, including libs created for schemas


More options are available - see the man pages, and read comments in the various CMakeLists.txt files.
