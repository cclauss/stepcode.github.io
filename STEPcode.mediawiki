'''STEPcode'''

The STEPcode project is a collection of open source libraries, tools, and resources for ISO 10303,
the STandard for the Exchange of Product (STEP) model data. 
Formerly known as the STEP Class Library (SCL), the project has evolved from its origins at NIST into a
diverse open source community helping improve the accesibility, adoption, and promotion of STEP amongst CAx developers.

This project provides a robust implementation of an EXPRESS schema parser for STEP's Part 21 files
with bindings provided in C, C++, and Python.
