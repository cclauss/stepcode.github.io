== Introduction ==
The STEPcode project is a collection of open source libraries, tools, and resources for ISO 10303,
the STandard for the Exchange of Product (STEP) model data, and other schemas based on the 10303-11 EXPRESS information modeling language such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) used for Building Information Modeling (BIM). 

Based originally on the NIST STEP Class Library (SCL), the STEPcode project has evolved into a
diverse open source community helping improve the accessibility, adoption, and long-term availability of STEP related technologies for CAx developers.

Currently, STEPcode provides a robust implementation of an EXPRESS schema parser for STEP's Part 21 files with bindings provided in C, C++, and Python.  STEPcode is used in other open source projects such as BRL-CAD (www.brl-cad.org), and the BSD license allows commercial use.

== Project Links ==

=== Source Code ===
The source is available on [http://github.com/stepcode/stepcode GitHub]

=== Testing ===
We use a CDash/CTest [http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=StepClassLibrary dashboard]. 

Unfortunately, it is not possible to view test from more than one day at once; you must use the '''Previous''' link for that.

== Schemas ==
There is a [[list of schemas]] that STEPcode has been tested with.

== To Do ==
A [[list of tasks]] that involve improving the wiki or STEPcode's source code.

== External Resources ==
A [[list of external resources]] related to STEP/EXPRESS.
