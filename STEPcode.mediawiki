== Introduction ==
The '''STEPcode''' project is a collection of open source libraries, tools, and resources that revolve around the technologies of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_10303 ISO 10303], a.k.a. STEP. Parts of the STEP specification are reused in other standards, so STEPcode use is not limited to ISO 10303.

STEPcode provides a robust implementation of
* an EXPRESS schema parser with bindings provided in C, C++, and Python
* additional libraries that allow STEP Part 21 files to be read and written
* various utilities, test routines, and test schemas

The [http://github.com/stepcode/stepcode/blob/master/COPYING BSD license] allows commercial use. In addition, STEPcode is used in other open source projects such as [http://www.brl-cad.org BRL-CAD].

=== STEP & Other Standards ===
ISO 10303 is commonly referred to as '''STEP''', the '''ST'''andard for the '''E'''xchange of '''P'''roduct model data. It can be used for neutral file exchange or as a basis for a data sharing or archiving in areas such as drafting, mechanical and assembly design, electromechanical design, machine tool control, PLCS (product lifecycle support), systems engineering, computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis.

STEPcode can be used with the following standards because they reuse [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-11 Part 11] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21 Part 21] of ISO 10303:
* AP203, AP214 and AP242 for CAD [http://www.cax-if.org]
* The Industry Foundation Classes ('''IFC''') are used for Building Information Modeling (BIM)
* ISO 15926 is used in the Oil & Gas industry
* STEP-TAS is used in the thermal analysis of aerospace equipment
* ISO 13584, ''Industrial automation systems and integration - Parts library''
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13399 ISO 13399]

=== Community ===
Based originally on the NIST STEP Class Library (SCL), the STEPcode project has evolved into a diverse open source community helping improve the accessibility, adoption, and long-term availability of STEP related technologies for CAx developers.

=== Using STEPcode ===
* [[How to use STEPcode in an application]]

=== Documentation ===
* '''[http://stepcode.org/doxygen/ Doxygen]''' for v0.6
* doxygen documentation of [http://stepcode.org/stepcode-use-doxygen/ apps using STEPcode]
* See also [[:Category:Code discussion]]

=== Schemas ===
There is a [[list of schemas]] that STEPcode has been tested with.

=== To Do ===
There is a '''[[list of tasks]]''' that involve improving the wiki or STEPcode's source code. In addition, there is a '''[[list of projects]]''' that are more difficult than the tasks; these might be appropriate for GSoC participants.

== Links ==
* The source code is on [http://github.com/stepcode/stepcode GitHub]
** Any discussion of the code on this wiki should have a <nowiki>[[Category:Code discussion]]</nowiki> tag so that it shows up in [[:Category:Code discussion]]
* The [http://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scl-dev mailing list] is hosted on google groups.
* We have a [http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=StepClassLibrary CDash dashboard] do show the status of recent test runs.
** Unfortunately, it is not possible to view tests from more than one day at once; you must use the '''Previous''' link for that. Testing is sporadic, and is generally only done for branches that are under review.
