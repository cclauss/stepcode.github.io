Improvements to STEPcode's source
---------------------------------

-   Support the unaltered AP203Amd1 (same fix as AP209 problem?)
-   Each unique p21read error should be printed only once, with a list
    of affected entities. Fall back to verbose errors via a switch, such
    as ''' '-v' '''?

    practices for (nested) external references
    -   this needs fleshed out and moved to the [list of
