== On the wiki ==
* Document the data structures in ''libexpress'', ''fedex_plus''
* Copy content from github wiki?
* More external links
* Logo, background
* syntax highlighting for C, C++, Python, EXPRESS, Part 21 '''[[Test code page|DONE]]
* etc etc etc

== Improvements to STEPcode's source ==
* Support AP209
* Support the unaltered AP203Amd1 (same fix as AP209 problem?)
* Each unique p21read error should be printed only once, with a list of affected entities. Fall back to verbose errors via a switch, such as ''' '-v' '''?
