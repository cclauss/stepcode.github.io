**STEPcode**

The STEPcode project is a collection of open source libraries, tools,
and resources for ISO 10303, the STandard for the Exchange of Product
(STEP) model data, and other schemas based on the 10303-11 EXPRESS
information modeling language such as the Industry Foundation Classes
(IFC) used for Building Information Modeling (BIM).

Based originally on the NIST STEP Class Library (SCL), the STEPcode
project has evolved into a diverse open source community helping improve
the accessibility, adoption, and long-term availability of STEP related
technologies for CAx developers.

Currently, STEPcode provides a robust implementation of an EXPRESS
schema parser for STEP's Part 21 files with bindings provided in C, C++,
and Python. STEPcode is used in other open source projects such as
BRL-CAD (www.brl-cad.org), and the BSD license allows commercial use.
