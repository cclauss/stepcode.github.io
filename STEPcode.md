STEPcode
========

Introduction
------------

The **STEPcode** project is a collection of open source libraries,
tools, and resources that revolve around the technologies of ISO 10303,
a.k.a. STEP. Parts of the STEP specification are reused in other
standards, so STEPcode is not limited to ISO10303.

STEPcode provides a robust implementation of

-   an EXPRESS schema parser with bindings provided in C, C++, and
    Python
-   additional libraries that allow STEP Part 21 files to be read and
    written
-   various utilities

The [http://github.com/stepcode/stepcode/blob/master/COPYING BSD
license](http://github.com/stepcode/stepcode/blob/master/COPYING BSD license "wikilink")
allows commercial use. In addition, STEPcode is used in other open
source projects such as [http://www.brl-cad.org
BRL-CAD](http://www.brl-cad.org BRL-CAD "wikilink").

### STEP

ISO 10303 is commonly referred to as **STEP**, the **ST**andard for the
**E**xchange of **P**roduct model data. It can be used as a data
exchange format in areas such as mechanical and assembly design,
electromechanical design, machine tool control, and finite element
analysis.

### Other Standards

All of the following standards use Parts 11 and 21 of ISO10303, which
are the EXPRESS information modeling language and the ASCII data
exchange format. Some also use Part 28, XML data exchange.

-   The Industry Foundation Classes (**IFC**) are used for Building
    Information Modeling (BIM)
-   ISO 15926 is used in the Oil & Gas industry
-   STEP-TAS is used in the thermal analysis of aerospace equipment
-   ISO 13584, *Industrial automation systems and integration - Parts
    library*

### History

Based originally on the NIST STEP Class Library (SCL), the STEPcode
project has evolved into a diverse open source community helping improve
the accessibility, adoption, and long-term availability of STEP related
technologies for CAx developers.

Project Links
-------------

### Source Code

The source is available on [GitHub](http://github.com/stepcode/stepcode)

### Testing

We use a CDash/CTest
[dashboard](http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=StepClassLibrary).

Unfortunately, it is not possible to view test from more than one day at
once; you must use the **Previous** link for that.

Schemas
-------

There is a [list of schemas](list of schemas "wikilink") that STEPcode
has been tested with.

To Do
-----

A [list of tasks](list of tasks "wikilink") that involve improving the
wiki or STEPcode's source code.
